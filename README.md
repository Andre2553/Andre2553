### Hi thereï¼ŒMy name is Andre

- Software Developer
- Mechatronics Technician
- Computer Scientist
- Aspiring Violinist

I am passionate about technology, I have been coding since I was 14 years old, and I have never let my love for this to get cold.

Technology has a lot more to contribute to our society. And I want to help it using my creativity and knowledge. 

If you have any good ideas or want to discuss with me about something, I will be more than happy to do so.

I will keep you posted about my adventures in this still mystery World.
